Tests
=====
There currenty are two type of tests: unit tests and integration tests, and they are run separately.

Assuming Grunt is installed, use ```grunt test``` to run unit tests and ```grunt integration-test``` to run the integration tests from the project's root folder (not from inside the test/ folder)
